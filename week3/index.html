                <p>This week’s task consisted in creating a kinetic sculpture, essentially an art<br>
                piece with movement attached to its presentation. My inspiration for this assignment<br>
                was a sculpture designed by Jonathan Prince (@jonathanprincesculpture) named “Cauldron”.<br>
                The sculpture is made out of Marine Grade Stainless Steel and its top shape resembles<br>
                the movement of ocean waves.</p>

                <p>With this idea in mind, I decided to create an ocean wave simulator,<br>
                using an arduino board and a motor. My first step was the planning and brainstorming,<br>
                which later guided me to sketch a simple triangular rod with circular like projections<br>
                on its foundation. The spinning of this mechanism would then create wave-like movement<br>
                on the surface above.</p>

                <p>I started by designing the support which connects the wood sticks together and makes a<br>
                solid foundation for the rod to spin. This required some measurements to be taken, basic<br>
                Fusion360 skills, and knowledge in laser cutting. The creation of a box was also required<br>
                and for this matter I decided to use the website Makercase, which basically does all th<br>
                dirty work for you in a couple clicks. Upon designing and testing all these pieces, they turned out<br>
                looking better than anticipated.</p>

                <p>Assembling it all together was the next step, I was required to use a drill to carve holes<br>
                in the box and the edges of the mechanism so the setup could be concluded. Once it was all put<br>
                together, I layed down a thin blue tissue paper on the top of the box so movement could be seen.<br>
                The arduino setup was simple and straightforward. Nothing more than a couple wires and some lines of code.<br>
                The mechanism turned out working well and no malfunctions happened.</p>

                <p>As the second part of the assignment, I was required to measure the voltage and do some<br>
