                <p>Welcome to my webinar space! Throughout this section I will be discussing some values that I learned<br>
                while taking the lead of creating a website by myself and also thinking through an impractical final project.</p>

                <p>Within the first week of work in this class, I was able to research many<br>
                    things and explore areas that I have never been exposed to before.<br>
                    This website for instance was practically a 3 day journey of learning and headaches,<br>
                    but in any case was an experience for me to stay more familiarized<br>
                    with coding and programming logic.</p>

                <p>Flipping the coin, I have my final project, which can be seen in the tab PROTOTYPE, following an<br>
                    ambitious idea of creating a hologram. Honestly, the idea has been fluctuating a lot because of<br>
                    how complex and out of the box I have to be to make this work. Another factor that I have not<br>
                    considered when I thought about the hologram was the budget limit that will guide me, in other<br>
                    words some technologies in this field can be extremely costly and require extensive research to make it work.</p>

                <p>Overall, I am excited to see how the whole thing will turn out 6 weeks from now.<br>
                I believe that from now on it is just a matter of research and effort to make my littl<br>
                project come to life</p>
