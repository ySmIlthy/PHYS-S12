Wassup! I am Felipe, currently 18 years old and a high school graduate.
I lived in Brazil for 15 years and I have been living in the US since 2021.
My dream is to change peopleâ€™s lives through my actions and desires, sometimes having to be simple to be effective.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, I plan to achieve my pHD before my 30s, going for research in quantum mechanics. 
I have always been passionate about challenging what is out of my reach. 
I believe that quantum not only fits my desires, but also reflects on how complex and confusing my mind is sometimes.
</p>

<p>
  I am excited to keep exploring at Harvard and I am grateful for having the opportunity to do so.
