<b>Week 1: Introduction</b>

<center>As someone that grew up with the marvel heroes, I always wanted to have a super power. 
Tony Stark was my inspiration this time around, more specifically the technology he produces.</center>

<p>I first started with a self-destructive safe, but upon reflecting on the project and on my short term memory loss, I noticed that I was creating nothing more than a bomb (Just like Tony Stark). 
After this explosive idea, I moved on to think about a way to manipulate light and the idea of the hologram came along.</p>

<p>My project is to create a prototype of a hologram, but not the boring pieces of plastic that sells on Amazon, an actual good one. A hologram that you can interact with is my idea. 
I find it particularly interesting because it allows you to enrich the space around you with thoughts, work, and entertainment.</p>

<p>I plan for the design to be simple because the idea is already pretty defying. I want to create an open box with mirrors on the top and bottom and a black metal tube in the center to be the foundation of the projections.
In this project, I will be using baby powder to make the beams visibles and use the black rod to help manipulate them.</p>
