                <p>Something really interesting came up and I was able to utilize my abilities of 3d printing to help<br>
                other peopleâ€™s projects. Essentially, for my other class, some of my peers had a device in which they<br>
                needed a stable way to adjust some sensors and lasers, so they could run some experiments. We call this<br>
                device Maglav and this will be the walkthrough of how I did its cover.</p>

                <p>Most, if not all the work, was designed in Fusion360. For my sketch, nothing more than a ruler was used<br>
                to take the measurements, which I thought would turn out as an issue, however it was not really the case.<br>
                Basically, I replicated the measurements I took and expanded them, so it would create a sort of case for the device.<br>
                I separated it into 2 files, respectively, the bottom of it and the actual case that would go on top and has the<br>
                designed space for the sensors.</p>

                <p>My biggest challenge was to make the software of the Dremel printer work, but after some clicks here and there<br>
                I was able to download it and set up the configurations for it. I then exported the model I had in Fusion360 to<br>
                Dremel software and everything from this point was just setting it up and changing the specifics for that print,<br>
                such as filament density, speed of the print, and balancing of the print board.</p>

                <p>The device turned out to be a perfect fit, yet I honestly think that it is way too tight for comfort, yet<br>
                they needed it as soon as possible so they could start running the experiments so they just stuck with it.</p>
